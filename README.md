# TreeDES
An variation of the famous simplified Data Encryption Standard using a Tree Parity Machine

I developed a form of the simplified DES using a key generated by the weight matrix of two tuned neural networks, which is commonly known as a Tree Parity Machine. It was implemented in MatLab.
The key generation function is Π(∑abs(Cij)) where C signifies column of the weight matrix.
